Welcome to HOP documentation!
===================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Welcome to HOP documentation. If you are a new comer we recommend you
to start reading the Get Started section. It will show you how to
install HOP Command Line Interface tool and the fundamentals of the tool.

Once you are familiar with the tooling and have completed (or read)
the :doc:`/get-started/run-hop-application-on-aws/main` tutorial, you can
also go through the How-to guides section. For example, you can
learn :doc:`/how-to/install-on-premises/main`.

Finally, you can check the reference for more information about HOP
CLI, AWS Infrastructure, Modules, Glossary, etc.
